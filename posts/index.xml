      <description>Purpose I always wanted to touch the holistic approach of TTD/BDD with CI/CD So this is the purpose of this series of blog posts. Now I have the oportunity to experiment more than usual. With this blog post I intend to dig into those subjects in the context of the following parameters:
 Golang as the language of choice Bosh as the deployment tool Concourse as the CI tool  My target is to go even further to the Google ecosystem and touch Kubernetes even.</description>

      <description>This is my third attempt to use Hugo. I must admit some times trying to persuade it that a post is not a draft is a bit painful. And to be honest I am not sure if it is Hugo&amp;rsquo;s fault or the theme&amp;rsquo;s. For what is worth I desided I am going to keep using it. There are a bunch of static site generators and each time I try to check which one I should use I end up on Jekyll.</description>

      <description>(update)
I cannot just sit standing with an issue like this so I looked around and found a solution. Adding the following under keybindings section of alacritty configuration file seems to do the trick:
- { key: Key3, mods: Alt, chars: &amp;#34;\x23&amp;#34; } A few days ago I started working on my dotfiles. I was sold on the idea of using that new kid in the block called alacritty. A brand new and shiny [rust] built terminal emulator which is woshiped by terminal hipsters lately.</description>
