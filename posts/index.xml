      <description>This is my third attempt to use Hugo. I must admit some times trying to persuade it that a post is not a draft is a bit painful. And to be honest I am not sure if it is Hugo&amp;rsquo;s fault or the theme&amp;rsquo;s. For what is worth I desided I am going to keep using it. There are a bunch of static site generators and each time I try to check which one I should use I end up on Jekyll.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I started working on my dotfiles. I was sold on the idea of using that new kid in the block called alacritty. A brand new and shiny [rust] built terminal emulator which is woshiped by terminal hipsters lately. A few words before I get down to this. Alacritty is a nice piece of software and this is not me naging about it. It mainly me sharing my experience.</description>
