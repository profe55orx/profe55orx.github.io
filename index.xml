      <description>This is my third attempt to use Hugo. I must admit some times trying to persuade it that a post is not a draft is a bit painful. And to be honest I am not sure if it is Hugo&amp;rsquo;s fault or the theme&amp;rsquo;s. For what is worth I desided I am going to keep using it. There are a bunch of static site generators and each time I try to check which one I should use I end up on Jekyll.</description>

      <description>(update)
I cannot just sit standing with an issue like this so I looked around and found a solution. Adding the following under keybindings section of alacritty configuration file seems to do the trick:
- { key: Key3, mods: Alt, chars: &amp;#34;\x23&amp;#34; } A few days ago I started working on my dotfiles. I was sold on the idea of using that new kid in the block called alacritty. A brand new and shiny [rust] built terminal emulator which is woshiped by terminal hipsters lately.</description>
